# Sims

## Introduction

I‚Äôve thought about this and started on this at least a dozen times. There must be some deeper insight as to why I keep coming back to it. To what am I referring?

An efficient, human-friendly way of browsing, comparing, and presenting various interfaces I‚Äôve either designed, borrowed, or worked with.

Named after [my favorite game to hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims) in middle school.

## Philosophy

The fastest path to learning whether a theorized solution actually solves the problem is to achieve an embodied experience for all parties invested.

Though heavily inspired by [Henry Dreyfuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss), [David Kelley](https://www.ideo.com/people/david-kelley), and‚Äîmost recently‚Äî[Tom Chi](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/video-tom-chi-on-rapid-prototyping-product-management/), I‚Äôve been describing this as **The Simulation Ceiling‚Ñ¢**. For modern software teams, this ceiling is often low and inhibiting by default but we have the ability to raise it by disruption.

So how do we raise the ceiling? By accelerating the rate at which we can present an embodied experience against the following principles:

1. **Humans first** ‚Äî no matter your argument, if humans haven‚Äôt tried it, we are blind and our work is like smoke
2. **Same day delivery** ‚Äî if we cannot present an idea while we still care about it, our vehicle is too slow
3. **Everything is temporary** ‚Äî if we cannot easily change it, it‚Äôs not realistic because we cannot know the future

It‚Äôs not a question of whether to change because change has already occurred in ways we could not predict‚Äîour people, our memory, and our position. Is the system adapting to the needs, knowledge, and skills of those who maintain it? To make anything likely costs less than half the expense to maintain.

You might say we are in the business of profit and growth, but by definition, we are in the business of humaneness and togetherness. (And for many, stubbornness.)

company ‚Äî _noun_ a commercial business; the fact or condition of being with another or others, especially in a way that provides friendship and enjoyment. _verb_ associate with; keep company with.

So what is keeping us apart?

The real trick is being able to [translate human value into the language of dollars](https://articles.uie.com/the-need-to-think-and-talk-like-an-executive/).

## Requirements

### Once

1. Data (facts)
2. Design (data structures + relationships; thanks Linus)
3. Functions (machine interface ‚Äî makers, mappers, manipulators)
4. Forms (human interface - access, action, allure)


### Ongoing

1. Author (who)
2. Delta (where & what)
3. Explanation (why)
4. Time (when)


## Targets & Projects

First target. Cycle through states.

1. [ ] First project. Define a set of data objects in series.
2. [ ] Render first object in series.
3. [ ] Build a cycle mechanism.
4. [ ] Ease the transitions between objects.

Second target. Apply distinct configurations.

- [ ] Airtable
- [ ] Artemis (one story to rule them all)
- [ ] Bambu
- [ ] Configurator (CPQ)
- [ ] Hatch (time paradox; chicken + egg; space between)
- [ ] Pulse
- [ ] Salesforce
- [ ] Sheets
- [ ] Sprout
- [ ] Zeus

Third target. Map content extensions starting with card catalogs.

1. [ ] Configurator (CPQ) Object Summary (first 3 cards)
2. [ ] Artemis Story Engine (first 3 cards)
3. [ ] Universal Entry Summary (first 3 cards)

Fourth target. Rework to catalog patterns.

## Schema

Should be self-evident based on data itself, but documenting here to affirm.

After completing the enumeration exercise below, I realize everything is made of the same parts. The Chinese are doing something right by making everything an extension of human conversation by embedding all utility into it. ‚úåüèº

That said, nothing is validated. The devil is in the details. üòà

And **the design is in the data**‚Äînot the other way around. Otherwise it‚Äôs a Guess Fest.‚Ñ¢
